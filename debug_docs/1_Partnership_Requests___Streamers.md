If streamers and other people ask for partnership → check the casino front page, and if there is Affiliates section, redirect players there: There are 2 scenarios possible after clicking on Affiliates (depending on the project): Players are redirected to a corresponding website. A special form appears, players need to fill it in and wait for the responsible partners to contact them: If there isn’t an Affiliates section on the casino front, or no info pops-up → inform the player that we are not looking for partnerships at the moment . It’s us who redirect the people seeking partnership to our Partners , it’s not our Affiliates Team or whoever else. The requesters should not get the impression that we are the same team as our Partners (and we are not, for real).
