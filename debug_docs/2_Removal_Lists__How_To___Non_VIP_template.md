Sometimes players decrease or stop their activity in the casino for different reasons. We do our best to support their deposit activity at a VIP level, but still their lifetime goes to its end. If a VIP manager did his/her best but the player does not show VIP numbers, there is no reason to spend time and power of a VIP manager to revive the player who has no potential anymore. To keep your base fresh, you need to prepare a special removal list for low-performing players at the end of each month. Those players will be checked by your Team Leads and eventually approved for removal by the Head of the Department. How to create a removal list Follow these steps to create a removal list: Download your base from Tableau. Identify the players who have no potential. Remove the rest of the players (by hiding or deleting rows). Add new columns for: - your comment, - a comment from your Team Lead, - a сomment from the Head of the Department - a checkbox to remove the ones approved for that Provide a comprehensive comment on why you want to remove each player on the list. Remove them after approval or follow other instructions given. How to identity a player for removal Pay attention to the following parameters: A player was transferred to another brand and stopped his/her activity in the previous casino. A player is winning and not making losses for the casino (or losses are low and accidental amid a very high WD for 3 months). Consider all the focused and calculating players for removal. A player just doesn't deposit and doesn't lose enough. If the player has been losing less than 800 EUR for 2 months in a row (AND this is NOT a legal reason like vacation), consider him for removal, if nothing helped to bring him/her back to decent numbers. A player refused to pass SOWQ verification and refused to go to another brand. A player asked for a break for an indefinite or a long period of time (and stopped playing at all). ATTENTION if you have doubts about putting a player into the list or not - do that with a proper comment of analysis and the TL will prompt you what to do. disabled players or the players with SE limits should NOT be added to the list How to submit a removal list Please, do share the access to your list when submitting it. IMPORTANT When removing the players, all their VIP tags and groups should be cleared! Remove yourself as a VIP manager, your personal tag (Aramuz) or group (SS), the only-VIP-manager-Cashback/FS tags as well as, “Very VIP much approved”, “no loyalty FS” and all the other VIP tags used by you. ATTENTION The rest of the columns should not be changed. Insert the columns for comments. Do not delete other columns! The removed players will be replaced by fresh ones some time after removal. How to inform a player about the removal IMPORTANT DO NOT send this message proactively. Only if the player messaged you first! If you need to say goodbye to the player, please use this template (only if the player messages you themselves first!): “Dear \_\_\_ , thank you for your activity with us, we highly appreciate you!
